# This is explaination about API that i build using flask

## Objective
This API are building using python and flask as a framework, so i will attach the file(s) too on this repos
Also, I'm gonna create ```Dockerfile``` too, because i wanna deploy it into my kubernetes cluster to test it working or not when it's came to production, ofc i'm still not using CI/CD for now, because i'm still tried to figure it out using manual deployment instead of using fancy automation out there...

## Files
For the fist API project, just simple gateway to achieve the minimum and building easiest pipeline possible
The progress will be separated into 3 stages, like the explanation below :
ðŸ”´ for the project that hasn't started yet 
ðŸŸ¡ when the project still on going 
ðŸ”µ for project that still unstable or not ready yet but the main logic and flow already implemented and work well
ðŸŸ¢ for project that done and successfuly working (production)
